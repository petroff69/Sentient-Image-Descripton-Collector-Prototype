### AI Image Scanning Prototype

This prototype leverages the **Vercel AI SDK**, **Claude**, and **Next.js** to create an AI-driven web application that scans images to extract both descriptions and embedded text, using **Sentient AI** for analysis.

#### Project Highlights
- **Image Understanding**: Uses AI to analyze and describe the content of uploaded images.
- **Text Extraction**: Automatically identifies and extracts any text from within images.
- **Built for Exploration**: A prototype showcasing the capabilities of AI in real-world image processing applications.

#### Getting Started
1. **Clone the Repository**
2. **Set up Environment Variables**:
   - Create a `.env.local` file and add `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-api-key`, replacing `your-api-key` with your actual Anthropic API key.
3. **Install Dependencies**:
   - Run `pnpm install` to install all required packages.
4. **Start the Development Server**:
   - Run `pnpm dev` to start the server in development mode.
